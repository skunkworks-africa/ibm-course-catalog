# Update IBM Courses and Match with Credly Badges

This document provides the details of the GitHub Actions workflow to update IBM courses and match them with Credly badges, along with the necessary directory structure and file contents.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The following workflow is scheduled to run daily at midnight UTC and can also be triggered manually from the GitHub UI.

```yaml
name: Update IBM Courses and Match with Credly Badges

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # This will run the workflow daily at midnight UTC.
  workflow_dispatch:  # This allows you to manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub UI.

jobs:
  fetch_and_process_data:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Fetch IBM Courses
        run: |
          curl -o course_feed.json https://www.ibm.com/training/files/GTPjson/CourseFeed_Global.json

      - name: Fetch Credly Badges
        env:
          CREDLY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CREDLY_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          curl -u "$CREDLY_TOKEN:" -X GET "https://api.credly.com/v1/badges" -H "Accept: application/json" -o badges.json

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Match Courses to Badges
        run: python match_courses_to_badges.py

      - name: Commit and Push Updates
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
          git config --global user.name "Your Name"
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Updated IBM courses and matched badges" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push

      - name: Notify Update
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: 'IBM Courses and Badges Update',
              body: 'IBM courses and matched badges were updated on ${new Date().toISOString()}.'
            })
```

### `match_courses_to_badges.py`

This is an example of what your `match_courses_to_badges.py` script might look like:

```python
import json
import pandas as pd

def load_data():
    with open('course_feed.json', 'r') as f:
        courses = json.load(f)
    
    with open('badges.json', 'r') as f:
        badges = json.load(f)
    
    return courses, badges

def match_courses_to_badges(courses, badges):
    # Example matching logic
    matches = []
    for course in courses['courses']:
        for badge in badges['data']:
            if course['title'] in badge['name']:
                matches.append((course['title'], badge['name']))
    return matches

def main():
    courses, badges = load_data()
    matches = match_courses_to_badges(courses, badges)
    
    # Save the matches to a CSV file
    df = pd.DataFrame(matches, columns=['Course', 'Badge'])
    df.to_csv('course_badge_matches.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### `requirements.txt`

```plaintext
requests==2.28.2
pandas==2.0.1
numpy==1.24.2
```
